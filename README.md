# Uber-Data-Analysis-Practise

This is Just a overview practise of UberDataset based on following statement:
  1. find number of rides for each dataset
  2. find number of rides for each base in each dataset
  3. Merge all the datasets and find total number of rides
  4. Find number of rides as per hours
  5. which base has the highest number of rides?
